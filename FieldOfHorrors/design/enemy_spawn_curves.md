# Enemy Spawn Curves (MVP)

## Goals
- 5–10 min runs with clear rhythm: ramp → spike → relief → ramp.
- Mix mechanical variety (Foam Finger knockback, Referee control, etc.).

## Curve A (Default – Linear + Elite Pulses)
- Minutes 0–2: Base Zombie + Foam Finger (low density)
- 2–4: Add Mascot Mask + Referee (first control checks)
- 4–6: Tailgate Bruiser (AOE bottles) + Streaker (speed checks)
- 6–8: Add Cheerleader (confusion) + Merch Seller (AOE zones)
- 8–10: Elite pulse every 30–40s; boss gate at 9:30–10:00

**Elite cadence:** every ~90s, with 1 modifier at first, 2 mods after 6:00.

## Curve B (Wavey – Cyclical Waves)
- Every ~90s: density spike + 15s relief window
- Elites occur at end of spike (mini-crest)
- More readable for beginners; pairs well with Arena mode

## Curve C (Hazard-Driven)
- Spawns stay steady; hazards (bleachers, fireworks, ice) escalate frequency
- Ideal for stages that “play the stage” more than the horde

## Tuning Notes
- Trash TTK mid-run: ~0.8–1.2s
- Elite HP: 3–5× trash; Boss: 30–50× trash
- Spawn caps scale with player count in co-op (avoid screen flood)
