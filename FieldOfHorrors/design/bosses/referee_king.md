# Boss: Referee King

## Fantasy
A towering undead referee who weaponizes rules: stun flags, penalty calls, whistle shockwaves. Horror-comedy tone with “official” cruelty.

## Arena
- Shape: Stadium 50-yard slice; hash marks, penalty cones (cover).
- Hazards: Randomized “spotlight sweeps” that blind; side-line drones launching foam-flag projectiles.

## Phase Overview
- **P1 – Flag Control (100–70% HP):**
  - Mechanics: Throws **Stun Flags** (slow/immobilize), **Whistle Shockwave** (radial knockback), **Penalty Line** (laser-straight hazard).
  - Adds: **Ref Ballboys** that retrieve flags; killing them delays his next throw.
- **P2 – Rulebook Rage (70–35% HP):**
  - Mechanics: **Yellow Card Rain** (flag mortar), **Holding!** (tethers player briefly), **Replay Review** (brief invuln; re-aims next attack).
  - Adds: **Ump Zombies** that grant him DR auras if not interrupted.
- **P3 – Overtime Judgment (35–0% HP):**
  - Mechanics: **Two-Minute Drill** (global haste), **Double Flag** (two overlap zones), **Ejection** (teleport slam).
  - Soft enrage: Hazards tick faster; whistle shockwaves chain twice.

## Player Counterplay
- **Linebacker:** Bash to interrupt **Replay Review**; soak shockwaves.
- **QB:** Summons body-block **Penalty Line** and soak **Flag Mortars**.
- **Pitcher:** Snipe Ballboys/Umps; curveball to tag while he strafes.
- **Batter/Center:** Close-range burst during **post-Whistle recovery**.
- **Point Guard:** Team haste + dash to exit **Holding** tethers.

## Rewards
- **Unique drop:** *Ref’s Golden Whistle* (on-hit micro-stun, long cooldown).
- **Recipe piece:** *Championship Gem Shard* (Batblade final tier).
- Cosmetics: **Striped Glow Jersey**, **Penalty Trail** (footstep VFX).

## Tunables (MVP targets)
- HP: ~40× a standard trash zombie.
- Stun Flag root: 0.85s (decays with difficulty).
- Shockwave knockback: 900 units; i-frames on perfect dash.
- Mortar warning: 1.2s telegraph; 4–6 shells.
- Enrage pace: +15% action speed <35% HP.

## QA Notes
- Flags never chain-lock the player longer than 2.5s total.
- Shockwave can’t push player out of the arena bounds.
- Replay Review invuln ≤ 2.0s (avoid frustration).
