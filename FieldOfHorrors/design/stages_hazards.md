# Stage Hazards Catalog (MVP + Expandables)

## Global Rules
- Hazards use **your locked palette** + 1 wild-card highlight if iconic.
- Telegraphs must be **clear** (readability > realism).
- Hazards scale with run time (frequency/size), not raw damage only.

   - Telegraph: arcs + ground circles; delayed explosions.
   - Variants: misfire dud (fake-out), cluster finale.
2) **Bleacher Collapse**
   - Telegraph: creaking + dust; collapses to impassable rubble.
   - After-effect: creates cover but blocks line of sight.
3) **Spotlight Sweep**
   - Telegraph: cone sweep path; on-hit: brief blind + accuracy loss.
4) **Tailgate Flames**
