# Enemy Variations – *Field of Horrors*

## Overview
The **Zombie Fan** is the baseline enemy archetype: mindless, sports-obsessed undead that roam every stage. Variations build on this core by introducing **mechanical differences** and **visual humor** while maintaining the horror-comedy sports theme. Each variation uses the **locked 10-color palette** with **one “wild card” highlight color** to keep silhouettes distinct.

Enemy philosophy:
- Every variation must play differently (not just cosmetic).
- Gore + comedy blend: silly violence in grotesque sports settings.
- Wild card colors emphasize iconic props (foam fingers, pom-poms, flags, etc.).
