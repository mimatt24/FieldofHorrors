# Player Classes – *Field of Horrors*

## Overview
Classes are designed as **hard counters** (specialized, like *Path of Exile*) rather than jack-of-all-trades.
- Each **sport = 2 subclasses** (Baseball, Football, Basketball for MVP).
- Future sports (Soccer, Hockey, Wrestling) may unlock after Ascension.
- Each subclass uses a **signature weapon type** but can wield other gear with **reduced bonuses**.
- Skill trees branch into **Early → Mid → Capstone tiers** with freedom of choice and risk/reward crystals (some off-class skills give **debuffs**).

## 📈 Class Progression
- **Between Runs:** Classes can level up and unlock new skill branches.
- **Currencies:** *Open for refinement* — suggestion is Tickets for subclass unlocks, but other systems (e.g., XP milestones or special boss drops) could be used.
- **Prestige/Ascension:**
  - Unlocks “Hall of Fame” variants of classes with glowing effects and cosmetic prestige skins.
  - Certain debuff crystals only available post-ascension.

---

## 🎨 Cosmetics & Prestige
Visual progression tied to jerseys and gear:
- **Tier 1:** Bloody/stained gear.
- **Tier 2:** Championship jerseys (glowing logos, metallic trim).
- **Tier 3 (Prestige):** Legendary skins (ethereal glow, neon patterns).

**Skin Ideas:**
- *Hall of Fame Jerseys* → glowing gold numbers.
- *Zombie Slayers* → shredded jerseys with bones sticking out.
- *Mascot Fusion* → players wear partial mascot armor.
- *Ascended Aura* → trails of fire, neon lights, or dripping blood effects.

---

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Co-op Support
- **Stacking Allowed:** Teams can run duplicate classes (e.g., 4 QBs).
- **Synergy Bonuses:** Potential feature post-ascension.
- **Core Design Goal:** Ensure 2–4 player co-op feels balanced and fun on Steam launch.

---

## ❌ Ultimates
- Currently **no ultimates planned** (to stay closer to *Path of Exile* pacing).
- Instead, **Capstone Skills** serve as “ultimate moments” earned mid-run.
