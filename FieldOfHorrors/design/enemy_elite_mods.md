# Enemy Elite Modifiers – Field of Horrors

## Goals
- Turn any regular variation into a memorable **elite** with 1–2 visible rule twists.
- Stay readable: big silhouettes, clear telegraphs, palette-locked + 1 wild card.

## Core Modifiers (MVP)
1) **Overtime**
   - Effect: +20% move/attack speed; on-kill haste burst (2s).
   - Visual: glow trail on feet; faint stopwatch icon.
   - Counter: kiting, stuns.

2) **Thick Skin**
   - Effect: +40% HP; stagger resistance.
   - Visual: cracked ceramic skin shader + metallic highlights.
   - Counter: piercing/armor shred, taunts.

3) **Explosive**
   - Effect: on death → small AOE; warning ring telegraph.
   - Visual: “fizzing” gas can strapped; blinking light.
   - Counter: ranged last hits; summon body block.

4) **Fanatic**
   - Effect: ignores soft CC; gains damage as HP lowers.
   - Visual: pulsating chest glow; chanting VO.
   - Counter: burst damage; knockbacks.

5) **Conductor**
   - Effect: periodic chain-lightning arcs to nearby enemies.
   - Visual: arcing sparks on shoulders; static hum.
   - Counter: spacing; stun windows.

6) **Flagbearer**
   - Effect: throws micro-stun flags; reduced cooldowns near allies.
   - Visual: glowing yellow flag; striped wristbands.
   - Counter: focus fire; line of sight.

7) **T-Shirt Cannon**
   - Effect: fires slow AOE shells; leaves merch clutter zones.
   - Visual: bright blue cannon; cotton puff VFX.
   - Counter: sidestep; destroy clutter.

8) **Mascot Shell**
   - Effect: first break removes 50% “shell” HP; becomes faster after.
   - Visual: cracked mascot head halves fall off.
   - Counter: commit or disengage—don’t half-measure.

## Stacking Rules
- Max **2 modifiers** per elite (avoid unreadable combos).
- If two chosen, pair **one mobility** with **one utility/damage** (e.g., Overtime + Explosive).

## Tuning Bands (start points)
- Overtime: +20% speed; haste burst = +30% for 2s.
- Thick Skin: +40% HP; stagger resistance 50%.
- Explosive: 1.0s telegraph; 250 base AOE damage (midgame).
- Conductor: jumps up to 3 targets; 0.8s interval; reduced in big crowds.

## Drops
- Slightly higher drop chance for **Craft Parts** and **Merch Tokens**.
- Unique shards for late-tier recipes have a small chance on double-mod elites.

## QA Notes
- Every modifier must be visible **before** it matters (1s+ tell).
- Elites should be **threat puzzles** not just HP sponges.
