# Security Policy
- Report vulnerabilities via GitHub Security Advisories or security@nowhere.invalid (update this).
- No secrets in repo. CI runs `gitleaks` to prevent commits with tokens.
- We use CodeQL + OpenSSF Scorecard.
- Rotating credentials and least-privilege access are recommended for integrations.
